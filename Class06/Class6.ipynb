    "# Class 6: Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "At the completion of this unit students should be able to:\n",
    "1. Understand the idea of algorithm complexity\n",
    "2. Understand how to use a recusive function\n",
    "3. Understand sorting and search problems and apply the right algorithm for each\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Algorithm complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of an algorithm is a concept that was developed in computer science in order to get an idea of how long an algorithm will take to solve a given problem. To explain this concept, let us start with a very simple example problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For a given number `N`, find the sum of all integer numbers less than or equal to `N`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already solved this problem before using a simple `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "s=0\n",
    "for a in range(N+1):\n",
    "  s+=a\n",
    "print(s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here in this chapter, want to find out how much time this loop will take to sum those numbers `<= N` for a given `N`. Let's assume that one loop iteration will take a very short time, something like 0.001 millisecond (or 0.001 ms). Then if `N = 1000`, it will take 1 ms. Generally, it will take `N * 0.001` ms for any `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In algorithm analysis, which is an important branch in computer science, we are interested in the `N` in `N * 0.001`. That is, we don't care much about how much *time* it will take, but we want to know how will the duration of execution of the algorithm depend on the problem size, `N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the computer science terminology, we say that this algorithm has a complexity of $N$. To use the full computer science terminology, we write that the complexity of this algorithm is $O(N)$, where $O$ denotes *of the order of*. This is known as the *big $O$ notation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary task of allgorithm analysts is to *reduce* the complexity of an algorithm. In this class, we will find out that for many problems in computer science, there are indeed several different ways to solve them, each with its own complexity, and some solutions have less complexity than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In this introductory course, you will **not** be asked to derive the $O(N)$ for new algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The complexity of a nested loop\n",
    "\n",
    "What about nested loops? Let's consider the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for a in range(N):\n",
    "  for b in range(N):\n",
    "    print(a*b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This loops performs a very silly task: it iterates `N` times, and within each of those iterations, it iterates `N` times. So by the end of execution, it will have iterated $N\\times N$ times in total. So the complexity is $O(N^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, will try to understand algorithms for common problems in computer science, and arrive at their complexity. Then, we can write algorithms for complex problems on our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Searching a list\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a list of numbers and you want to find a number in that list. You don't know initially whether the number is there or not of course, so the result of the search could be \"Number not found\". How do we go about this?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is obviously a job for a loop. I will write the solution as a function that receives the list as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def search_list(the_list,value):\n",
    "  for a in range(len(the_list)):\n",
    "    if the_list[a] == value:\n",
    "      print('Found ' + str(value) + ' at ' + str(a))\n",
    "      return\n",
    "  print('Not found!')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily find the complexity of this algorithm: if the length of the list is $N$, the complexity is some number that is less than or equal to $N$. That's because: if the values was found in the beginning of the list, the loop will iterate only once (best case scenario), while if it wasn't found at all in the list, the loop will iterate $N$ times (worst case scenario).\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's the $O(N)$ here?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule: when specifying the complexity for an algorithm, we *only* consider the worst case scenario. So the complexity is $O(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But such complexity won't be good enough when searching a *really* large list. For example, what would Google do when you look up the web pages that are indexed on its servers? There are billions of pages on Google's list. If Google was going to use the code above for searching a page in a list, a search would take hours to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we need a better algorith i.e. an algorithm with a smaller complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary search\n",
    "\n",
    "A much better, yet a bit more complicated, search algorithm is the binary search algorithm. For this algorithm to work, the list must already be ordered. Here is the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def binary_search(the_list, value):\n",
    "  first = 0\n",
    "  last = len(the_list)-1\n",
    "  found = False\n",
    "  while first <= last and not found:\n",
    "    middle = (first + last)//2\n",
    "    if the_list[middle] == value:\n",
    "      found = True\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "      if value < the_list[midpoint]:\n",
    "        last = middle-1\n",
    "      else:\n",
    "        first = middle+1\n",
    "  return found\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this algorithm work? Let's take it step by step. We start with a list that has $N$ elements. If the item is not found in the first iteration, we continue searching the list after *splitting it into two halves*, and continuing the search into one of the two halves: either from the `first` element up to `middle`, or from `middle` down to the `last` element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if the value is not found, we proceed to the next `while` iteration by again splitting the list into two halves - those two halves are two quarters of `the_list`. In the worst case scenario, we keep splitting the halves into halves, which means we proceed as shown in the table below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step | Size of remaining list|\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| 1 | $N/2$|\n",
    "| 2 | $N/4$|\n",
    "| 3 | $N/8$|\n",
    "| 4 | $N/16$|\n",
    "| ... | ...|\n",
    "| $M$ | $N/2^M$|\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M$ here is the number of iterations. $M$ is the last step of the loop, at which there will be only 1 element in the remaining list. To get the complexity of the algorithm, we solve the equation $1 = N/2^M$ in terms of $N$. The solution is $M={\\rm log}_2(N)$. So the complexity is $O(N)={\\rm log}_2(N)$, which is much less than $N$, especially when $N$ is in the order of billions!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.3 Sorting a list\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's move on to a different, but very common problem: sorting, or ordering a list of values. We assume here that we are dealing with a list of numbers, to make things simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bubble sort\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest sorting algorithm. Here, we start from the first element and repeat the swapping operation. The swapping operation is a three-step operation in which we swap thhe values of two variables. Let's say we have two variables `a` and `b`. The three steps are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "temp = a\n",
    "b = a\n",
    "a = temp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we used a third, temporary variable `temp` to keep the value of `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see how this is used in the bubble sort algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "n = len(arr) \n",
    "for i in range(n): \n",
    "  for j in range(0, n-i-1): \n",
    "      if arr[j] > arr[j+1]: \n",
    "          arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what is the complexity of this algorithm? Let's think about it. If the list is sorted descendingly and we want to sort it ascendingly, the inner loop will have to run for the whole `0` to `n-j-1` every time the outer loop is run. The actualy number of iterations will be $N \\times N/2$, which has a big $O$ notation $O(N^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.4 Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is when a function calls itself. For example, you can write a function that does recursion, or a *recursive function*, such as this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def recursiveFunction():\n",
    "  print(\"I just ran.\")\n",
    "  recursiveFunction()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When this function is invoked, it will print `\"I just ran.\"`, and then call `recursiveFunction()` again, which will print `\"I just ran.\"` and so on. It will never stop; it will run an infinite number of times. So we need some way to make it stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a modification of `recursiveFunction()` that will make it stop after a number of times:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def recursiveFunction(n):\n",
    "  if n == 10:\n",
    "    return\n",
    "  print(\"I just ran.\")\n",
    "  recursiveFunction(n+1)\n",
    "\n",
    "recursiveFunction(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call this function while passive the argument `n = 1`, it will recursively call itself while incrementing `n`.\n",
