Understand the difference between a primitive data type and a collection data type \n","2.   Understand that a string is a list and demonstrate how to access its characters\n","3. Understand and use the four basic collection data types in python: `list`, `tuple`, `set` and `dictionary`.\n","4. Differentiate between collection data types based on whether it is ordered, indexed, mutable and allows duplicates.\n","\n","## 2.1 Lists\n","\n","### Creating lists\n","A `list` in python is exactly what its name suggests, a list of things. Like a list of numbers, names, or even a mix of both. To create a list, we have to follow a simple syntax rule: enclose the things in the list between two *square brackets*, like those `[` and `]`, and separate between the list elements using commas, `,`. So for example, here is a list of numbers: `a = [4,6,7,1,0]`, a list of strings: `a = [\"a\",\"?\",\"neptune is a planet\"]`, a list of both: `a = [3,0,\"Where is my car?\"]`.\n","\n","Well, you can also create a list of lists in python! And you can *nest* as many lists as you want. Here is an example: `a = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]`. This is a list of three elements, each element being itself a list of two elements.\n","\n","### Accessing and changing list elements\n","\n","To access a list element, we apply this syntax rule: find out what the *order* of that element is, and then access it using the square brackets. The order of an element in a list is an integer. The order of the first element is always `0`. Here is an example.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ky8PLcbhcx2U","outputId":"7af72918-697a-40cc-98ef-ffdb7f5ed2d4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1663074171057,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":456,"user":{"displayName":"Sherif Tawfik","userId":"08424006537682359657"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"source":["a = [\"I\",\"want\",\"to\",\"order\",\"the\",4,\"dollars\",\"mocha\",True]\n","print(a[7])"],"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["mocha\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VkbDLnA0bYBm"},"source":["The string `'I'` is the first element of list `a`, and therefore its index is `0` and can be retrieved by typing `a[0]`.\n","\n","We can change the element in a list by just assigning it a new value.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"A8mAR-psgASy","outputId":"84ad6569-ee61-47a3-89bb-45b6cea43e1c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1663074408219,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":636,"user":{"displayName":"Sherif Tawfik","userId":"08424006537682359657"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"source":["a = [\"I\",\"want\",\"to\",\"order\",\"the\",4,\"dollars\",\"mocha\"]\n","a[0] = \"yes you can!\"\n","print(a[0])"],"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["dollars\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WzPRbinQgAbH"},"source":["Here we changed the value of the sixth element, with index 5, to `4.5`.\n","\n","So, what we've learned about lists is that they are *ordered*, *indexed* and can be changed i.e. *mutable*.
