Understand the conditional statement\n","2.  Understand the loop statement\n","3.   Understand the concept of variable scope\n","4. Utilise loop statement to draw impressive structures with the `turtle`\n","\n","## 3.1 More on operators: logical operators `and`, `or`, `not`\n","\n","These three logical operators operate on boolean expressions to result in boolean values. The meaning of these operators is just what the words mean. `a and b` will give `True` only if both `a` and `b` are `True`, otherwise it gives `False. `a or b` will give `False` only if both `a` and `b` are `False, otherwise it gives `True`. `not a` will give `False` if `a` is `True`, and vice versa.\n","\n","### The `in` operator\n","\n","This operator tests if an value belongs to a list or a set. The situation with dictionaries is different: `in` will return whether a value belongs to the list of *keys*, not *values*, of a dictionary.\n","\n","## 3.2 The conditional statement\n","\n","So far, we have been dealing with simple python statements. Each statement could be written in a single line of code, and they instructed the computer to perform a single task. For example, `a = 4` instructs the computer to put `4` into `a` and that's it.\n","\n","Serious programming starts when we let the computer make decisions after it tests certain conditions. Instead of just printing a name, how about we get the computer to print the name only **if** it starts with letter `A`?\n","\n","I just said **if**, which means: some condition should be tested before the print statement is executed. Now let me introduce the `if` statement in python. This statement has the following syntax:\n","\n","```\n","if boolean_expression:\n","  some_statements\n","```\n","\n","The `boolean_expression` evaluates to either True or False. The `if` statement will only execute the statements if `boolean_expression` evaluates to `True`. Otherwise, these statements will not be executed.\n","\n","So, to solve the above problem, here is the code:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ivaenupAEvjK","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1581253585098,"user_tz":-660,"elapsed":1017,"user":{"displayName":"Sherif Tawfik","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pkq2qTyEGvM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFoA/jDXaFewCL-s/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"08424006537682359657"}},"outputId":"29316fa7-ff35-4721-82d7-631d7b733ba4"},"source":["s = 'Ahmed'\n","if s[0] == 'A':\n","  print(s)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Ahmed\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ndQOrYbRDv20","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Indentation and blocks in python\n","\n","Not the syntax here: the `if` keyword must be followed by the expression, then a colon `:`. In the next line, the `some_statements` has been **indented**. Indentation means: typing space, or tabs, before the statetment. Here, you can notice that `print(s)` has some space before it. By doing this, you are telling the compiler: if the condition is met, **only** execute the line of code that are indented. The indented statements form a *block*.\n","\n","How much space? Well, you can add as much as you want, as long as you are consistent within the block.
