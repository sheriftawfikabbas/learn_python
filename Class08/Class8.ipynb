You can handle multiple exceptions by adding multiple `except` blocks in your code. The way the exception handler works is top-to-bottom: if searches your `except` blocks, starting from the first one, to an appropriate exception handler. Once it fires the `except` block, no further except blocks will be executed.\n",
