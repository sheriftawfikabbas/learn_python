Understand the concepts of encoding and decoding a plain text message\n","2. Apply the `cryptography` module to implement based symmetric cryptography\n","\n","## 11.1 Terminology\n","\n","- **Plain Text**:  is the text which is readable, and which we want to keep as a secret.\n","- **Cipher Text**: is the message obtained after applying cryptography on plain text.\n","- **Encryption (or encoding)**: is the process of converting plain text to cipher text.\n","- **Decryption (or decodinig)**: is the process of converting cipher text to plain text.\n","- **Symmetric encryption**: is when a plain text can be encrypted and decrypted using the same key.\n","- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: is a block cipher standardized by NIST. AES is both fast, and cryptographically strong. It is a good default choice for encryption. For more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard.\n","- **KDF (Key Derivation Function)**: A cryptographic hash function that derives one or more secret keys from a password. For more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function.\n","- **Fernet**: is an implementation of symmetric cryptography. For more information: https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/.\n","\n","\n","Here we will focus on the Fernet class for symmetric cryptography.\n","\n","## 11.2 Python string prefixes: row and byte\n","\n","A python string literal can be prefixed by a letter that indicates the type of characters in that string. String prefixes are documented here: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals. Will briefly discuss it in today's class.\n","\n","There are two types of string literals (or string values) in python: row string literals, which are the ones we have been dealing with so far, and byte string literals.\n","\n","Bytes string literals are always prefixed with 'b' or 'B'. For example, this is a byte string literal: `b\"Hi there!\"`, where as this is a row string literatal: `\"Hi there!\"`.\n","\n","A byte string literal is an instance of the *bytes* type instead of the *str* type. Let's check that using the `type()` function."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DnMreycR777N","colab_type":"code","outputId":"30b6db78-0ea9-4cee-ec15-5e95d336cbb9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1588899581971,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":898,"user":{"displayName":"Sherif Tawfik","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pkq2qTyEGvM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFoA/jDXaFewCL-s/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"08424006537682359657"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52}},"source":["a = b\"Hi there!\"\n","print(type(a))\n","\n","a = r\"Hi there!\"\n","print(type(a))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'bytes'>\n","<class 'str'>\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"75IBIEcP5_WG","colab_type":"code","outputId":"28b8fb53-f1a3-4d8f-877a-365806f2716f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1588867958921,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":2837,"user":{"displayName":"Sherif Tawfik","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pkq2qTyEGvM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFoA/jDXaFewCL-s/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"08424006537682359657"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":85}},"source":["b = b'Some text string'\n","print(b)\n","print('Decode byte to str: ',b.decode('utf-8'))\n","\n","r = r'Some text string'\n","print(r)\n","print('Encode str to byte', r.encode('utf-8'))\n","\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["b'Some text string'\n","Some text string\n","Some text string\n","b'Some text string'\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OdgMSuwu78SW","colab_type":"text"},"source":["They may only contain ASCII characters; bytes with a numeric value of 128 or greater must be expressed with escapes.\n","\n","### Generation of random numbers and bytes\n","\n","Random number and string generation is very impotant in cryptography because it enables key generators to have unexpected (random) features which cannot be prediced by adversaries.
