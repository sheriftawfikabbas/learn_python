Understand how to request an API, and receive the response, and the structure of a JSON string\n","2. Access the content of a JSON string via the python `json` library\n","\n","\n","##   API request and response handling\n","\n","When you visit a website, you are sending a request to the server to access the page you are visiting. The server responds to your request by providing your web browser with HTML file.\n","\n","For example, let's have a look at a very simple web page that I am keeping at this link:\n","\n","http://www.sheriftawfikabbas.com/blog/basic.html\n","\n","There is a single line there. Let's have a look at HTML code of this simple page:\n","\n","```\n","<html>\n","  <head>\n","    <title>I am a very simple web page</title>\n","  </head>\n","  <body>\n","    This is the stuff in the body of this web page.\n","  </body>\n","</html>\n","```\n","\n","You can also access the above code via your browser (depends on which browser you are using).\n","\n","So, the structure of the data  that is returned in the response is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The request that you send here is called the http request (note that you start the web address with \"http://\").\n","\n","Another way of requesting information on the web is via the API. The API (application programming interface) lets you request data, instead of requesting a page. There are several formats for the API data, but we will focus here on the JSON format for two reasons: it is very popular, and it resembles the python `dictionary` data structure.\n","\n","Let's have a look at an example website that lets you obtain the International Space Station astronauts in a JSON string.\n","\n","http://api.open-notify.org/astros\n","\n","That's an example of a JSON string, it looks exactly like a `dictionary`. The `people` key in the string is a `list` of dictionaries. \n","\n","The JSON syntax rule is: JSON is a `dictionary` of items. Each item could be a simple item, or a `list`. The `list` must have at least one `dictionary`.\n","\n","We can access an API in python via the `requests` library. Here is the code to do that.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":51},"colab_type":"code","executionInfo":{"elapsed":1018,"status":"ok","timestamp":1588289149979,"user":{"displayName":"Sherif Tawfik","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pkq2qTyEGvM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFoA/jDXaFewCL-s/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"08424006537682359657"},"user_tz":-600},"id":"oXnRgKlUK_0Q","outputId":"4b2616cd-35e4-4df2-af2b-456e63ceb77b"},"outputs":[],"source":["import requests\n","response = requests.get(\"http://api.open-notify.org/astros\")\n","data = response.json()\n","print(type(data))\n","print(data)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"h5fxr8P8XrGE"},"source":["\n","Now let's have a look at some more interesting APIs.\n","\n","Check this out: https://openweathermap.org/current\n","\n","This page documents how  you can use the OpenWeather API to access the current weather at a particular city.

It's asking for an API key. Why is that?\n","\n","An API runs on a server and serves the data requirements of many internet users. The number of those users could be thousands, or even millions. Imagine how many people are accessing the Google Directions API every minute.\n","\n","Because of that, providers of APIs only allow access to their APIs via an API key. This key is usually a large complex string, like `439d4b804bc8187953eb36d2a8c26a02`, which is the key in the example link above (note, this key is only valid for requesting the London weather; try requesting the weather of Melbourne, it won't work).\n","\n","API providers will then restrict the access of the API service to a specific number of requests per some time interval.
