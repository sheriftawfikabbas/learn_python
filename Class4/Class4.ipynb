Understand the syntax of function declaration\n","2.   Create python functions for various applications\n","\n","## 4.1 Function declaration\n","\n","The invention of functions was a major milestone in the history of programming languages. Functions gave birth to the *procedural programming paradigm* during the 1950s-1970s. You can find more info about this interesting topic here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming.\n","\n","What's a function? A function is a block of code that can be invoked on demand. To understand the importance of functions, let say you want have hundreds of lines code that you want to invoke repeatedly in your program. If you wish to use these lines of code, then you can copy-paste them wherever you want to invoke them. However, if you need them in multiple places in the code, then copy-pasting might not be the most efficient way to write code. \n","\n","Alternatively, we place these lines of code into a python *function*. The syntax for *function definition* is as follows:\n","\n","```\n","def my_function():\n","  some_statements\n","```\n","Here we *defined* a new python function that is *named* `my_function`. This function can be *called* by simply typing\n","\n","```\n","my_function()\n","```\n","\n","This function definition has three parts: a function *name*, the `()` and `some_statements`. When you *call* the function, the computer will execute the statements in `some_statements` block. Let's have an example.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4AmTXa9WQJ7o","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1584058231088,"user_tz":-660,"elapsed":1933,"user":{"displayName":"Sherif Tawfik","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pkq2qTyEGvM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFoA/jDXaFewCL-s/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"08424006537682359657"}},"outputId":"17e54ff5-4e4b-43c6-852a-c035e40cd62f"},"source":["def print_hello():\n","  print('Hello, I need my coffee!')\n","\n","print_hello()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Hello, I need my coffee!\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IG-cZ5gVycM0","colab_type":"text"},"source":["So that's how we *call* a function: we use its name, and add the `()` to it.
