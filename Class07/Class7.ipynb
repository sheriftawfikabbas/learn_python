    "# Class 7: Object oriented programming 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "At the completion of this unit students should be able to:\n",
    "1.   Understand the difference between a class and an object\n",
    "2.   Understand how to create a new class\n",
    "3. Explain the difference between a class (static) variable and an instance variable.\n",
    "4. Understand how to inheret a class\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.1 The concept of the class\n",
    "Object oriented programming (OOPing) is a programming paradigm that and was invented in 1960s with the Simula language. Please refer to the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#History for a historical background if you are interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the main OOPing languages available today are Java, C++, C#, PHP and of course python. Each of these languages apply the OOPing concept in its own way. Here, we learn how python does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOPing is based on the concept of the object. An object is a programming construct which encapsulates data (state) and methods to process that data (behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a description of objects with the same type of data and the same methods. That is, it is the *blueprint* of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a very simple example, we are interested in the following aspects of employees.\n",
    "- Data: name\n",
    "- Data: hourly pay rate\n",
    "- Behaviour: calculation of weekly pay\n",
    "\n",
    "Each employee is an object. The employee class is a general description, or blueprint, of all employees. An employee object is sometimes called an instance of the employee class. The employee object has two pieces of data, the employee name and hourly rate. That object also can *do* something: calculate the weekly pay based on the hourly pay rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.2 Class definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a python class using the keyword `class`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "  stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let us define a class that has a variable `salary` set to `300`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "  salary = 300\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we defined a new class, `Employee`, which is also a new data type, that has one piece of data: the variable `salary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also add functions, or *methods* to a class. For example, let's add a simple `print_salary(self)` method to our `Employee`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "  salary = 300\n",
    "  def print_salary(self):\n",
    "    print(self.salary)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " And of course we can add as many variables and methods to a class.\n",
    "\n",
    " Variables declared inside a class are called *instance variables*, and methods declared in a class are *instance methods*.\n",
    "\n",
    " Did you notice the argument `self` in the instance method `print_salary`? We will discuss this soon.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Creating an object\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is created by calling the name of the class. The syntax is\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "v = MyClass()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The object, which is referenced by the variable `v` above, will exist in memory while the program is executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of the object's variable is the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's demonstrate the type of the object using the `type()` function:\n",

The constructor in python is a special instance method that is implicitly called whenever an object of that class is called. It also has a weird name: `__init__()`.\n",

Initially, the value of `a` when accessed via the class `A`, as well as via an instance of the class `inst_A`, is the same: `4`.

    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental features of OOPing is the ability of a class to inherit another class. This is the property of *inheritance*, which I will explain in terms of an example before we dig into the programming details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our organisation there are employees, which we represent with the Employee class. Employees in the organisation have different jobs: accountants, programmers, security, managers, etc. An accountant and a programmer are both employees and can be represented by the `Employee` class; they both have salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "But they are different:\n",
    "- The accountant has access to accounts, while the programmer doesn't\n",
    "- The programmer has access to a server, while hte accountant doesn't\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need some way to add an additional feature to each employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Inheritance* is the way to add those features to those two different types of employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python implements inheritance using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "  stuff\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So the inheriting class, `ChildClass`, will have access to the methods and variables of the inherited class, `ParentClass`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The child class can access the methods and variables of the parent class via by using the parent's class name, as follows:"
