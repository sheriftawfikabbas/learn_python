Therefore, I will be going slowly and in thorough detail to make sure that the ideas are going through smoothly.\n","\n","# Learning Outcomes\n","\n","On successful completion of this subject students will be able to:\n","\n","**Knowledge**:\n","1. explain the fundamentals of procedural programming,\n","2. explain the principles of inheritance, composition, polymorphism.\n","**Skills**:\n","1. design, develop and debug procedural, modular and object oriented programs,\n","2. demonstrate the use of inheritance and code re-use,\n","3. create and use libraries and package.\n","\n","# Topics covered are\n","\n","1. Procedural and object oriented programming (OOP)\n","2. Software engineering principle\n","3. API programming\n","4. Object and class identification: attributes, methods, constructors\n","5. OOPing principles: inheritance, composition and polymorphism\n","6. Code debugging, testing and documentation\n","\n","# Applications\n","\n","During the course, the student will learn to use a number of python libraries in various application spaces in order to broaden the student's understanding of the capabilities of pyhton.\n","\n","- Drawing with python's `turtle`\n","- Python `requests` module for web API access. We will access a number of APIs including:\n","  - The International Space Station API, open-notify.org\n","  - Google Directions API\n","  - Google Geolocation API\n","  - Open Weather API, https://openweathermap.org/api\n","  - Hajigando API, hosted at http://sheriftawfikabbas.com/hajigando, and lets the students talk with a funny chat bot via an API\n","- Manipulating JSON files using the `json` module\n","- Working with data files using `pandas`, which is key for doing data science tasks\n","\n","\n","# Hackerrank interview questions\n","Hackerrank is a new job interview platform where employers post problems in their relevant programming language, such that the shortlisted job seekers can accesss those problems and solve them online within a given time limit.\n","\n","A large number of problems in various programming languages, including python, are available for free.\n","\n","This course will encourage students to accesss these problem and submit their solutions through the online Hackerrank portal. This will expose students to various problems with varying degrees of difficulty. And will also prepare students for the job market.\n"]}]}
